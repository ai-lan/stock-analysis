# stock-analysis
Module 2
Background
Steve loves the workbook you prepared for him. At the click of a button, he can analyze an entire dataset. Now, to do a little more research for his parents, he wants to expand the dataset to include the entire stock market over the last few years. Although your code works well for a dozen stocks, it might not work as well for thousands of stocks. And if it does, it may take a long time to execute.

In this challenge, you’ll edit, or refactor, the Module 2 solution code to loop through all the data one time in order to collect the same information that you did in this module. Then, you’ll determine whether refactoring your code successfully made the VBA script run faster. Finally, you’ll present a written analysis that explains your findings.

Refactoring is a key part of the coding process. When refactoring code, you aren’t adding new functionality; you just want to make the code more efficient—by taking fewer steps, using less memory, or improving the logic of the code to make it easier for future users to read. Refactoring is common on the job because first attempts at code won’t always be the best way to accomplish a task. Sometimes, refactoring someone else’s code will be your entry point to working with the existing code at a job.

## Written Analysis of VBA Challenge

** Overview of Project

The main purpose of this challenge was to edit or refract the code to loop through all of the criteria for the data and analyze the duration it took for the analysis of the collected data. The main goal of the challenge was to determine when the codes has been altered or fracted in one way or another, did the script of the VBA run faster. The challenge in this module focus on the refactoring process because it is a critical point of the coding process. The edit or refractor of the code does not necessarily mean that the code is changed or a new code has been added to the overall script, it is simple a method to test the efficiency of the code or the overall script.
